# sj-utan-sol

an EXTREMELY valuable chrome extension when booking trains. Displays where the sun will shine based on the position of departing station, destination and time of travel.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastianandreasson/sj-utan-sol/master/readmeScreenshot.png)

Made while sitting in the sun during a train ride, there are probably lots of bugs. I've pretty much only tested gbg - sthlm and sthlm - gbg which is where I travel!

# install
